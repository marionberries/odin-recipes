    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Overnight oats. What could be easier? Hush, you spent $200 on lunch alone last
        week, so no complaining. Eating healthy on a budget doesn't have to be painful and overnight
        oats offer a quick and easy solution for the busy go-getter. The important 
        thing about this recipe is to make it the night before and to them rest,
        unlike you because you're up all night trying to meet that deadline.
        But you wouldn't be making this if you weren't such a rockstar, now would you?

    <p><em>Ingredients</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oats (except steel cut)</li>
        <li>Milk or other non-dairy milk</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choosing</li>
        <li>Refridgerator</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Steps</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine equal parts oats and milk into a container</li>
        <li>Add toppings</li>
        <li>Place container in fridge and allow to sit overnight</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Author's note: what Big Oatmeal doesn't want you to know is that
        you can actually let the oatmeal rest for 15 minutes and it'll still be good.
        The key is to use quick oats as old fashioned, steel cut, or rolled oats might
        be too robust for such a quick turn around.
