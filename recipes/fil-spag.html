    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Many of you may wonder: "Why is it called Filipino Spaghetti? And what is 
        this urge to know more?" Well, buckle up buckaroo because you're in for a wild ride.
    </p>

    <p>Filipino spaghetti does indeed share some common ingredients with a tomato based 
        pasta dish, perhaps a ragu. You have your pasta, tomato sauce, onion, garlic,
        ground beef, and some salt to taste. But this is where the commonalities end.
        Things start to take a turn with the addition of processed cheese, Filipino 
        ketchup (i.e. banana sauce), red hot dog slices, and sugar. Lots of it.
    </p>

    <p>Those with a discerning palette will understand why this dish has become
        The culinary classic it is today. So without further ado, I present
        Filipino Spaghetti.
